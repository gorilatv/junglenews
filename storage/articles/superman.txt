Title: Superman High Expectations
Slug: Superman High Expectations
Subtitle: Expectations s so High into Social Media

Excerpt: The Man of Steel returns to the screen in a new epic film.

Content: The 2025 Superman was directed by the multifaceted filmmaker James Gunn. And I say this because, besides being a director, he's also a screenwriter, producer, actor, and musician from the United States. His career began in the mid-90s as a screenwriter, penning titles such as Tromeo and Juliet, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and others.

Oh, my friends, I almost forgot… come closer, I’ll whisper it to you… pssss… Do you know another movie he wrote? None other than the excellent Dawn of the Dead (2004) — if you haven’t seen it yet, watch it!

---
Back to the topic… As a director, his most recent hits include the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy (2014, 2017, and 2021) and The Suicide Squad (2021), in addition to directing and producing the I Am Groot series (2022), all during his time at Marvel.
Switching Gears to DC and the Leadership Change

---
In 2022, recognizing his talent at Marvel — and aiming to “fix the house” after several missteps in the DC Universe (DCU) — Warner Bros. Discovery hired James Gunn as co-president and co-CEO of DC Studios.

---
His first project in this new phase was the creation of the Peacemaker series — which received mostly positive reviews. The show tests irreverent humor and highlights the excellent collaboration between its two biggest assets: James Gunn (as director) and John Cena (as actor). It was praised by both critics and fans.
High Investment in Superman: Legacy

---
Superman: Legacy is a high-budget film, with estimates suggesting the investment exceeds $200 million, possibly reaching around $400 million. That’s a very large sum, marking the film as DC Studios’ most important release and the starting point of its new cinematic universe.

---
Expectations are high, especially with a strong cast including David Corenswet as Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane.

---
Despite the massive investment, it’s expected that the film will yield significant financial returns — driven by the character’s iconic appeal and the fresh direction taken by DC Studios.

---
Now, with the announcement and upcoming release of Superman (working title), anticipation is sky-high — but not without uncertainty.
Positive Points Seen in the Trailers

---
Emotional and inspiring tone: Unlike previous, darker versions, the trailer shows a Superman with classic values, hope, and a more heroic, human approach — reminiscent of Superman: The Animated Series and the Golden/Silver Age comics.

---
Modern-retro visuals: Superman’s costume, with vibrant colors and a retro design, pleased nostalgic fans and modern audiences looking for something different among so many dark superheroes.

---
Promising cast: David Corenswet as Clark Kent shows charisma and presence. Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane also stood out with a strong and energetic performance in the scenes shown.

---
Soundtrack and editing: The trailer is well-built, with a rising rhythm and a soundtrack that aims to capture emotion and grandeur.

---
Massive online engagement: BoxOfficeThe.com analysts point to the record-breaking trailer views — the first full trailer had over 250 million views, making it the most-watched DC trailer in Warner Bros. history.

---
Strong fan sentiment and social media engagement, with early marketing reactions being very positive.

---
Strategic release schedule: The film launches ten days after Jurassic World: Dominion, allowing Superman to dominate the following weekend with minimal direct competition.

---
Fantastic Four by Marvel premieres two weeks later, giving both films breathing room — especially since Superman might benefit from strong word-of-mouth. Currently, expectations for Fantastic Four and the Marvel brand are relatively low.

---
Negative or Controversial Points

---
Lack of impactful action scenes: Some fans complained that the trailer is "pretty, but bland," especially due to the lack of epic action scenes — something expected from a Superman movie.

---
Inevitable comparisons with the Snyderverse: Part of the fanbase remains loyal to Zack Snyder’s visual style. To them, the new Superman might feel "too soft," which could divide opinions.

---
Lack of clarity about the new DCU: As Gunn is rebooting the entire universe, casual viewers may be confused about continuity. The trailer doesn’t clearly explain if there are ties to previous films, which could impact broader audience engagement.

---
Common complaints revolve around the new Superman suit, skepticism toward James Gunn, and attachment to the former actor/director Henry Cavill, who had been re-hired before Gunn decided on a new direction.

Box Office Expectations

Considering all factors, the box office projections are moderately optimistic:
If marketing continues emphasizing classic heroic values and adds more action in upcoming trailers, the film could open with $100 to $130 million domestically (USA) in its first weekend.

---
Internationally, the character’s appeal and Gunn’s direction could push the global total to $300–400 million in the first few weeks — with the potential to surpass $800 million overall if reviews are favorable.

---
Risk: If the film doesn’t deliver the expected visual and emotional weight — especially in final trailers — interest may drop, particularly among more demanding fans.

---
Conclusion

James Gunn seems to be betting on a more optimistic, classic, and emotionally rich approach to reintroduce Superman to cinema. Critics and fans are watching closely, torn between hope for a new era and skepticism born from DC’s past failures.

The key to success lies in balancing nostalgia, innovation, and action — and the next trailers will be decisive in securing (or losing) public trust before the film's release.
